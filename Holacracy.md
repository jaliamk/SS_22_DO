## How does Holacracy work?

- a system to steer clear from traditional pyramidal hierarchies
- implementation of self-managed teams and individuals

---

## Distributed Authority

- Authority and decision making are distributed among fluid circles
- People across the organization have the power to make decisions
- Not just a few individuals at the top of the pyramid

---

## Circles

- equivalent of teams in traditional organizations
- each circle has a clear purpose 
    -traditional teams are functional, focused on delivering tasks

---
## Circles

- a new role != new hire 
    - circles evolve constantly, while traditional teams tend to be fixed
- circles naturally include people with different sets of expertise
    - traditional teams are often one-dimensional

---

## Circle Lead Link

- responsible for allocating people to roles 
- can define an overall strategy and priorities 
- is responsible for all unassigned accountabilities 

- Circle Lead Links *do not* tell people how to do their jobs

---

## Energizing Roles

- No fixed positions and job titles
- Multitude of roles that are organized in circles and all contribute to the organization's purpose
- *Energizing roles* - People hired to bring energy to those roles

---

- No one can tell you how to do your job
- When you are assigned to a role, you take responsibility for that role

- your results are in line with the role's accountabilities
- your actions are in line with your role's purpose
- you are not impeding on another role's domain

---
## Integrative Decision Making

- Any circle member can propose changes
- Other members can only object if that change would negatively impact their own work 
- Permission needs to be given

---
## Governance Meetings

- Focused on the structure of the circle
- If someone has identified the need to create, remove or modify a role
- this will be processed in the next governance meeting

---
## Tactrical meeting

- Focused on the operational work of the circles

It is discussed:
- *who* to ask for permission on a specific decision
- *when* to approach the subject 
- *how* to approach the subject

---

## Processing Tensions

- Tension: a gap between the current reality and the potential you sense for one of your roles
- opportunity to improve
- your responsibility to "process" that tension
- raising of that tension with the appropriate people at the next tactical or governance meeting
